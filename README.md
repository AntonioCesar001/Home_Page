# Home Page - React Application

This project is a simple **Home Page** application built using **React** for the front-end. It doesn't contain any back-end, making it ideal for learning how to structure a front-end application with React.

## Features

- Basic structure of a home page.
- React components for building the interface.
- Simple styling using CSS.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed on your computer before starting.

You can check if Node.js is installed by running the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If you donâ€™t have **Node.js** installed, you can [download it here](https://nodejs.org/).

## How to Install React

1. **Install Node.js and npm**:
   - **npm** (Node Package Manager) is installed automatically with Node.js. Check the npm version with:

   ```bash
   npm -v
   ```

2. **Create a New React Project**:
   - Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create the project.
   - Run the following command to create a new React application:

   ```bash
   npx create-react-app home-page
   ```

   This will create a new folder called `home-page` with all the initial React setup.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd home-page
   ```

   - React comes pre-configured with the necessary dependencies.

4. **Start the Development Server**:
   - To see the application in action, run the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will open the application in your browser (usually at `http://localhost:3000`).

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/home-page.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd home-page
   ```

3. Install the dependencies with npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

Now you should be able to see the React application in your browser!

## Project Structure

- **public/index.html**: The main HTML file where React will be mounted.
- **src/App.js**: The main component of the application.
- **src/index.js**: The entry point for React, where `App.js` is rendered.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **CSS**: Simple styles for the home page.
